0/2 Extra Credit - Hourglass can be resized by changing only one Class Constant.

I strongly recommend that you read section 2-5 in the book.  It walks
you through doing a project exactly like this, using nested for loops
to minimize the number of static methods you need to create, and make
the size of the hourglass easy to change.

Your use of for loops in this program does nothing except make the
program longer.  Every single one of your for loops executes only one
time, and could simply be removed for more efficiency.  At no point
do you use a for loop to perform a repetitive task repetitively.

The top four lines of sand in the hour glass can be printed with
a single static method, using a calculation to determine how many spaces
to print and how many colons to print, and using a for loop print that
many of each on each line based on the calculation.  I walked through
an example of that step by step in class, and provided you the exact
procedure to do those calculations, and an example of the exact structure
of the for loops involved.  The book has the same information.

You are definitely going to need to be able to do for loops
in a way that is useful and productive moving forward in this class.
I strongly recommend that you dedicate some time to additional review
on the material you have been provided.  And I also strongly recommend that
you re-do this assignment using a single static method for the four
lines of sand at the top of the hourglass, and a single static method
for the four line of sand at the bottom of the hourglass.

The structure inside those methods should look like:

public static method topSand() {
	for (int line = 1; line <= 4; line++) {
		int numSpaces = (put your calculation here);
		int numColons = (put your calculation here);
		for (int space = 1; space <= numSpaces; space++) {
			// print a space
		}
		// print a backslash
		for (int colon = 1; colon <= numColons; colon++) {
			// print a colon
		}
	}
}
